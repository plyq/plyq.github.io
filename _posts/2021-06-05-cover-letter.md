Hi! 

I just tried to write a cover letter to copy paste it everywhere. I wanted to do it a long time ago, but here we go:

_Hi!_

_I am Artem. I was a math olympian in the past and became to be a super python engineer now. The future is vague, but in the far distance, I see a logo of one US high-salary smart-employees company is shining._

_Why super, you ask? When I was almost 0 in programming, a year later I became a team lead of the head company product. Or when somebody asked me to add some API with Flask and add some filters with Vue.js to the web app – no problem – next day and we are here. (Oh forgot to say, I didn’t know what is Flask and Vue.js until that moment). I don’t know tons of frameworks, but I believe that 2 days are enough to write something with any framework._

_Why future is vague, you ask? Because if it will be only my decision to decide should I work with you or not, your logo could be much brighter in this vague._

_According to the “how to write cover letter” guide, I should write a salutation, an attention-grabbing opening paragraph that introduces myself, my intention to apply for the open role, at least two paragraphs describing your relevant professional experience, achievements, skills, and education. I graduated from Saint-Petersburg State University – Russian Master’s degree equivalent. Seems, we closed all points and ready for the next steps, don’t we?_
