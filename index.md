description: Hi! My name is Artem. My passion is to solve puzzles. I was an IMO candidate at the school. I helped all my course to pass an exam of algebra and group theory. Now I am finding puzzles at developing things. So if you have a task for non-trivial thinking feel free to ask me, I will do my best.
